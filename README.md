# Image Captioning Using Vision Encoder-Decoder Model and GPT-2

This project demonstrates an image captioning system that generates textual descriptions of images using a Vision Encoder-Decoder Model integrated with GPT-2. By leveraging powerful transformers, this model can provide accurate and contextually rich captions for given images.

## Introduction

Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions for images. This project uses a Vision Encoder-Decoder Model to process the images and GPT-2 for generating coherent and contextually accurate captions. The Vision Encoder-Decoder Model encodes the visual features of the image, while GPT-2 decodes these features into natural language descriptions.

## Dataset

To train or test the model, you need a dataset containing images and corresponding captions. Popular datasets for image captioning include the MS COCO dataset and the Flickr8k dataset.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Requests

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch transformers pillow requests
```

### Generating Captions for Images

To generate captions for images, run the `caption_image.py` script. You can specify the path to the image and the output file for the generated caption.
